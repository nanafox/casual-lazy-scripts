# casual-lazy-scripts

#### A little workspace for my <i>lazy</i> self. ðŸ¤½ <br /> I use this workspace to write <em>lazy scripts</em> I find myself using often as a Desktop Support Tech.

#### They may not be the most optimized because I write them casually during times I feel lazy. In the future, I might write <em>better optimized</m> scripts
